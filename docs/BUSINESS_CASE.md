# Ledgoria: Business Case for Investment

**A Compliance-First Applicant Tracking System**

*Executive Summary for Sponsorship and Investment*

---

## Executive Summary

The Applicant Tracking System (ATS) market represents a $3.2B opportunity growing at 6.5% CAGR, yet the market leaders—built in the 2010s—are showing their age. They optimize for recruiter throughput at the expense of compliance, candidate experience, and integration with modern trust infrastructure.

**Ledgoria** is a next-generation ATS built on a different premise: *hiring should be both fast and defensible*. By making compliance the architecture rather than an afterthought, and by natively integrating identity verification and background screening, we can capture the segment of the market where hiring defensibility is non-negotiable.

**The Ask:** $2.4M seed investment to reach MVP and initial customer deployment within 12 months.

**The Return:** A product that captures 2-3% of the SMB ATS market within 5 years, generating $15-20M ARR with a path to strategic acquisition or Series A expansion.

**Strategic Fit:** Ledgoria extends Ledgoria's existing trust infrastructure into the pre-hire workflow, creating a full-lifecycle identity and verification platform that no competitor can match.

## Market Opportunity

### Market Size

| Segment | TAM | SAM | SOM (5-Year) |
|---------|-----|-----|--------------|
| Global ATS Market | $3.2B | - | - |
| North America ATS | $1.4B | - | - |
| SMB Segment (50-500 emp) | - | $480M | - |
| High-Compliance Verticals | - | $180M | $25-35M |

**Sources:** Grand View Research, Gartner, internal analysis

### Market Dynamics

**Growth Drivers:**
- Regulatory complexity increasing (EEOC, OFCCP, state-level requirements)
- Remote hiring requiring stronger identity verification
- Candidate expectations rising (transparency, mobile, speed)
- HR tech consolidation creating integration fatigue

**Market Gaps:**
- No ATS has native background check integration (all are bolt-on)
- Compliance features are afterthoughts in market leaders
- SMB underserved—forced to choose enterprise complexity or consumer simplicity
- Adverse action workflows universally poor

### Competitive Landscape

| Vendor | Strength | Weakness | Target |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Greenhouse** | UX, brand | Expensive, compliance gaps | Mid-market+ |
| **Lever** | CRM features | Complex, high churn | Mid-market |
| **Workday** | Enterprise suite | Overkill for SMB, slow | Enterprise |
| **iCIMS** | Compliance | Dated UX, complex | Enterprise |
| **JazzHR** | Price | Limited features, no compliance | Small business |
| **Breezy HR** | Ease of use | No compliance depth | Small business |

**White Space:** Compliance-first ATS for SMB in regulated industries. No current player owns this positioning.

## Strategic Rationale

### Why Now?

1. **Regulatory Pressure Intensifying**
   - NYC Local Law 144 (AI in hiring) effective 2023
   - State-level pay transparency laws expanding
   - EEOC increasing enforcement activity
   - GDPR/CCPA creating data handling complexity

2. **Background Check Integration Broken**
   - Current model: ATS → Background Check = manual handoff
   - Adverse action compliance = manual process
   - No ATS has solved this natively

3. **Trust Infrastructure Maturing**
   - Digital identity verification now mainstream
   - Credential verification (education, employment) automatable
   - Portable trust profiles becoming viable

4. **Incumbent Vulnerability**
   - Greenhouse/Lever focused on enterprise upsell
   - Legacy vendors (iCIMS, Taleo) losing ground
   - No incumbent has compliance as core value prop

### Why Ledgoria?

**Existing Assets:**
- Background screening infrastructure already built
- Identity verification capabilities proven
- Compliance expertise (FCRA, adverse action)
- Customer relationships in target verticals

**Strategic Extension:**
- Ledgoria captures the *pre-screening* workflow
- Creates full-lifecycle platform (source → screen → verify → hire)
- Increases customer stickiness and LTV
- Differentiates against pure-play background check vendors

**Competitive Moat:**
- Only ATS with native trust infrastructure
- Compliance built into architecture, not bolted on
- Background check integration that competitors cannot match
- Adverse action workflow that is actually correct
